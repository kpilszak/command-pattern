## General info
This project shows usage of command pattern.  
The main principle is to encapsulate a request as an object. This lets parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests and support undoable operations.   

In command pattern we define:
1. Command interface with method like execute()
2. Request class
3. Concrete classes implementing the command interface.
4. Command Invoker class.
